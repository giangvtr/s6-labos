s more time and
    space. If we were to use a different container to
    cross-reference into this hash-table using these iterators - it
    would take much more space. As noted in <a href=
    "#assoc_find_it_range_it">Using Point-Type Iterators for
    Range-Type Operations</a>, nothing much can be done by
    incrementing these iterators, so why is this extra information
    needed?</p>

    <p>Alternatively, one might create a collision-chaining
    hash-table where the lists might be linked, forming a
    monolithic total-element list, as in Figure <a href=
    "#find_its_in_hash_tables">Point-type iterators in hash
    tables</a>-B (this seems similar to the Dinkumware design
    [<a href="references.html#dinkumware_stl">dinkumware_stl</a>]).
    Here the iterators are as light as can be, but the hash-table's
    operations are more complicated.</p>

    <h6 class="c1">Point-type iterators in hash tables.</h6>

    <p>It should be noted that containers based on
    collision-chaining hash-tables are not the only ones with this
    type of behavior; many other self-organizing data structures
    display it as well.</p>

    <h4><a name="assoc_inv_guar" id="assoc_inv_guar">Invalidation
    Guarantees</a></h4>

    <p>Consider the following snippet:</p>
    <pre>
it = c.find(3);

c.erase(5);
</pre>

    <p>Following the call to <tt>erase</tt>, what is the validity
    of <tt>it</tt>: can it be de-referenced? can it be
    incremented?</p>

    <p>The answer depends on the underlying data structure of the
    container. Figure <a href=
    "#invalidation_guarantee_erase">Effect of erase in different
    underlying data structures</a> shows three cases: A1 and A2
    show a red-black tree; B1 and B2 show a probing hash-table; C1
    and C2 show a collision-chaining hash table.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Erasing 5 from A1 yields A2. Clearly, an iterator to 3
      can be de-referenced and incremented. The sequence of
      iterators changed, but in a way that is well-defined by the
      <u>interface</u>.</li>

      <li>Erasing 5 from B1 yields B2. Clearly, an iterator to 3 is
      not valid at all - it cannot be de-referenced or incremented;
      the order of iterators changed in a way that is (practically)
      determined by the <u>implementation</u> and not by the
      <u>interface</u>.</li>

      <li>Erasing 5 from C1 yields C2. Here the situation is more
      complicated. On the one hand, there is no problem in
      de-referencing <tt>it</tt>. On the other hand, the order of
      iterators changed in a way that is (practically) determined
      by the <u>implementation</u> and not by the
      <u>interface</u>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So in classic STL, it is not always possible to express
    whether <tt>it</tt> is valid or not. This is true also for
    <tt>insert</tt>, <i>e.g.</i>. Again, the iterator concept seems
    overloaded.</p>

    <h3><a name="assoc_methods" id="assoc_methods">Slightly
    Different Methods</a></h3>

    <p>[<a href="references.html#meyers02both">meyers02both</a>]
    points out that a class's methods should comprise only
    operations which depend on the class's internal structure;
    other operations are best designed as external functions.
    Possibly, therefore, the STL's associative containers lack some
    useful methods, and provide some other methods which would be
    better left out (<i>e.g.</i>, [<a href=
    "references.html#sgi_stl">sgi_stl</a>] ).</p>

    <h4><a name="assoc_ers_methods" id="assoc_ers_methods">Methods
    Related to Erase</a></h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Order-preserving STL associative containers provide the
      method
        <pre>
iterator 
    erase
    (iterator it)
</pre>which takes an iterator, erases the corresponding element,
and returns an iterator to the following element. Also hash-based
STL associative containers provide this method. This <u>seemingly
increases</u> genericity between associative containers, since, <i>
        e.g.</i>, it is possible to use
        <pre>
<b>typename</b> C::iterator it = c.begin();
<b>typename</b> C::iterator e_it = c.end();

<b>while</b>(it != e_it)
    it = pred(*it)? c.erase(it) : ++it;
</pre>in order to erase from a container object <tt>
        c</tt> all element which match a predicate <tt>pred</tt>.
        However, in a different sense this actually
        <u>decreases</u> genericity: an integral implication of
        this method is that tree-based associative containers'
        memory use is linear in the total number of elements they
        store, while hash-based containers' memory use is unbounded
        in the total number of elements they store. Assume a
        hash-based container is allowed to decrease its size when
        an element is erased. Then the elements might be rehashed,
        which means that there is no "next" element - it is simply
        undefined. Consequently, it is possible to infer from the
        fact that STL hash-based containers provide this method
        that they cannot downsize when elements are erased
        (<a href="assoc_performance_tests.html#hash_based">Performance
        Tests::Hash-Based Container Tests</a> quantifies this.) As
        a consequence, different code is needed to manipulate
        different containers, assuming that memory should be
        conserved. <tt>pb_ds</tt>'s non-order preserving
        associative containers omit this method.
      </li>

      <li>All of <tt>pb_ds</tt>'s associative containers include a
      conditional-erase method
        <pre>
<b>template</b>&lt;
    <b>class</b> Pred&gt;
size_type
    erase_if
    (Pred pred)
</pre>which erases all elements matching a predicate. This is
probably the only way to ensure linear-time multiple-item erase
which can actually downsize a container.
      </li>

      <li>STL associative containers provide methods for
      multiple-item erase of the form
        <pre>
size_type
    erase
    (It b, 
        It e)
</pre>erasing a range of elements given by a pair of iterators. For
tree-based or trie-based containers, this can implemented more
efficiently as a (small) sequence of split and join operations. For
other, unordered, containers, this method isn't much better than an
external loop. Moreover, if <tt>c</tt> is a hash-based container,
then, <i>e.g.</i>, <tt>c.erase(c.find(2), c.find(5))</tt> is almost
certain to do something different than erasing all elements whose
keys are between 2 and 5, and is likely to produce other undefined
behavior.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4><a name="assoc_split_join_methods" id=
    "assoc_split_join_methods">Methods Related to Split and
    Join</a></h4>

    <p>It is well-known that tree-based and trie-based container
    objects can be efficiently split or joined [<a href=
    "references.html#clrs2001">clrs2001</a>]. Externally splitting
    or joining trees is super-linear, and, furthermore, can throw
    exceptions. Split and join methods, consequently, seem good
    choices for tree-based container methods, especially, since as
    noted just before, they are efficient replacements for erasing
    sub-sequences. <a href=
    "assoc_performance_tests.html#tree_like_based">Performance
    Tests::Tree-Like-Based Container Tests</a> quantifies this.</p>

    <h4><a name="assoc_insert_methods" id=
    "assoc_insert_methods">Methods Related to Insert</a></h4>

    <p>STL associative containers provide methods of the form</p>
    <pre>
<b>template</b>&lt;
    <b>class</b> It&gt;
size_type
    insert
    (It b,
        It e);
</pre>for inserting a range of elements given by a pair of
iterators. At best, this can be implemented as an external loop,
or, even more efficiently, as a join operation (for the case of
tree-based or trie-based containers). Moreover, these methods seem
similar to constructors taking a range given by a pair of
iterators; the constructors, however, are transactional, whereas
the insert methods are not; this is possibly confusing.

    <h4><a name="assoc_equiv_comp_methods" id=
    "assoc_equiv_comp_methods">Functions Related to
    Comparison</a></h4>

    <p>Associative containers are parametrized by policies
    allowing to test key equivalence; <i>e.g.</i> a hash-based
    container can do this through its equivalence functor, and a
    tree-based container can do this through its comparison
    functor. In addition, some STL associative containers have
    global function operators, <i>e.g.</i>,
    <tt><b>operator</b>==</tt> and <tt><b>operator</b>&lt;=</tt>,
    that allow comparing entire associative containers.</p>

    <p>In our opinion, these functions are better left out. To
    begin with, they do not significantly improve over an external
    loop. More importantly, however, they are possibly misleading -
    <tt><b>operator</b>==</tt>, for example, usually checks for
    equivalence, or interchangeability, but the associative
    container cannot check for values' equivalence, only keys'
    equivalence; also, are two containers considered equivalent if
    they store the same values in different order? this is an
    arbitrary decision.</p>

    <h3><a name="assoc_mapping_semantics" id=
    "assoc_mapping_semantics">Alternative to Multiple Equivalent
    Keys</a></h3>

    <p>Maps (or sets) allow mapping (or storing) unique-key values.
    The STL, however, also supplies associative containers which
    map (or store) multiple values with equivalent keys:
    <tt>std::multimap</tt>, <tt>std::multiset</tt>,
    <tt>std::tr1::unordered_multimap</tt>, and
    <tt>unordered_multiset</tt>. We first discuss how these might
    be used, then why we think it is best to avoid them.</p>

    <p>Suppose one builds a simple bank-account application that
    records for each client (identified by an <tt>std::string</tt>)
    and account-id (marked by an <tt><b>unsigned long</b></tt>) -
    the balance in the account (described by a
    <tt><b>float</b></tt>). Suppose further that ordering this
    information is not useful, so a hash-based container is
    preferable to a tree based container. Then one can use</p>
    <pre>
std::tr1::unordered_map&lt;std::pair&lt;std::string, <b>unsigned long</b>&gt;, <b>float</b>, ...&gt;
</pre>which <u>hashes every combination of client and
account-id</u>. This might work well, except for the fact that it
is now impossible to efficiently list all of the accounts of a
specific client (this would practically require iterating over all
entries). Instead, one can use
    <pre>
std::tr1::unordered_multimap&lt;std::pair&lt;std::string, <tt><b>unsigned long</b></tt>&gt;, <b>float</b>, ...&gt;
</pre>which <u>hashes every client</u>, and <u>decides equivalence
based on client</u> only. This will ensure that all accounts
belonging to a specific user are stored consecutively.

    <p>Also, suppose one wants an integers' priority queue
    (<i>i.e.,</i> a container that supports <tt>push</tt>,
    <tt>pop</tt>, and <tt>top</tt> operations, the last of which
    returns the largest <tt><b>int</b></tt>) that also supports
    operations such as <tt>find</tt> and <tt>lower_bound</tt>. A
    reasonable solution is to build an adapter over
    <tt>std::set&lt;<b>int</b>&gt;</tt>. In this adapter,
    <i>e.g.</i>, <tt>push</tt> will just call the tree-based
    associative container's <tt>insert</tt> method; <tt>pop</tt>
    will call its <tt>end</tt> method, and use it to return the
    preceding element (which must be the largest). Then this might
    work well, except that the container object cannot hold
    multiple instances of the same integer (<tt>push(4)</tt>,
    <i>e.g.</i>, will be a no-op if <tt>4</tt> is already in the
    container object). If multiple keys are necessary, then one
    might build the adapter over an
    <tt>std::multiset&lt;<b>int</b>&gt;</tt>.</p>

    <p class="c1">STL non-unique-mapping containers, then, are
    useful when (1) a key can be decomposed in to a primary key and
    a secondary key, (2) a key is needed multiple times, or (3) any
    combination of (1) and (2).</p>

    <p>Figure <a href="#embedded_lists_1">Non-unique mapping
    containers in the STL's design</a> shows how the STL's design
    works internally; in this figure nodes shaded equally represent
    equivalent-key values. Equivalent keys are stored consecutively
    using the properties of the underlying data structure: binary
    search trees (Figure <a href="#embedded_lists_1">Non-unique
    mapping containers in the STL's design</a>-A) store
    equivalent-key values consecutively (in the sense of an
    in-order walk) naturally; collision-chaining hash tables
    (Figure <a href="#embedded_lists_1">Non-unique mapping
    containers in the STL's design</a>-B) store equivalent-key
    values in the same bucket, the bucket can be arranged so that
    equivalent-key values are consecutive.</p>

    <h6 class="c1">Non-unique mapping containers in the STL's
    design.</h6>

    <p>Put differently, STL non-unique mapping
    associative-containers are associative containers that map
    primary keys to linked lists that are embedded into the
    container. Figure <a href="#embedded_lists_2">Effect of
    embedded lists in STL multimaps</a> shows again the two
    containers from Figure <a href="#embedded_lists_1">Non-unique
    mapping containers in the STL's design</a>, this time with the
    embedded linked lists of the grayed nodes marked
    explicitly.</p>

    <h6 class="c1"><a name="embedded_lists_2" id=
    "embedded_lists_2"><img src="embedded_lists_2.png" alt=
    "no image" /></a></h6>

    <h6 class="c1">Effect of embedded lists in STL multimaps.</h6>

    <p>These embedded linked lists have several disadvantages.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The underlying data structure embeds the linked lists
      according to its own consideration, which means that the
      search path for a value might include several different
      equivalent-key values. For example, the search path for the
      the black node in either of Figures <a href=
      "#embedded_lists_1">Non-unique mapping containers in the
      STL's design</a> A or B, includes more than a single gray
      node.</li>

      <li>The links of the linked lists are the underlying
      data structures' nodes, which typically are quite structured.
      <i>E.g.</i>, in the case of tree-based containers (Figure
      <a href="#embedded_lists_2">Effect of embedded lists in STL
      multimaps</a>-B), each "link" is actually a node with three
      pointers (one to a parent and two to children), and a
      relatively-complicated iteration algorithm. The linked lists,
      therefore, can take up quite a lot of memory, and iterating
      over all values equal to a given key (<i>e.g.</i>, through
      the return value of the STL's <tt>equal_range</tt>) can be
      expensive.</li>

      <li>The primary key is stored multiply; this uses more
      memory.</li>

      <li>Finally, the interface of this design excludes several
      useful underlying data structures. <i>E.g.</i>, of all the
      unordered self-organizing data structures, practically only
      collision-chaining hash tables can (efficiently) guarantee
      that equivalent-key values are stored consecutively.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The above reasons hold even when the ratio of secondary keys
    to primary keys (or average number of identical keys) is small,
    but when it is large, there are more severe problems:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The underlying data structures order the links inside
      each embedded linked-lists according to their internal
      considerations, which effectively means that each of the
      links is unordered. Irrespective of the underlying
      data structure, searching for a specific value can degrade to
      linear complexity.</
