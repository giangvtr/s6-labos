The Black Knight
    
    As he moves, the BLACK KNIGHT bars the way.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    None shall pass.

    ARTHUR
    What?

    BLACK KNIGHT
    None shall pass.

    ARTHUR
    I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must
    cross this bridge.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    Then you shall die.

    ARTHUR
    I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    I move for no man.

    ARTHUR
    So be it!

    ARTHUR draws his sword and approaches the BLACK KNIGHT. A furious fight now starts
    lasting about fifteen seconds at which point ARTHUR delivers a mighty blow which
    completely severs the BLACK KNIGHT’s left arm at the shoulder. ARTHUR steps back
    triumphantly.

    ARTHUR
    Now stand aside worthy adversary.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    (Glancing at his shoulder)
    ’Tis but a scratch.

    ARTHUR
    A scratch? Your arm’s off.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    No, it isn’t.

    ARTHUR
    (Pointing to the arm on ground)
    Well, what’s that then?

    BLACK KNIGHT
    I’ve had worse.

    ARTHUR
    You’re a liar.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    Come on you pansy!

    Another ten seconds furious fighting till ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHTS’s other
    arm off, also at the shoulder. The arm plus sword, lies on the ground.

    ARTHUR
    Victory is mine.
    (sinking to his knees)
    I thank thee O Lord that in thy …

    BLACK KNIGHT
    Come on then.

    ARTHUR
    What?

    He kicks ARTHUR hard on the side of the helmet. ARTHUR gets up still holding
    his sword. The BLACK KNIGHT comes after him kicking.

    ARTHUR
    You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    Had enough?

    ARTHUR
    You stupid bastard. You haven’t got any arms left.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    Course I have.

    ARTHUR
    Look!

    BLACK KNIGHT
    What! Just a flesh wound.
    (kicks ARTHUR)

    ARTHUR
    Stop that.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    (kicking him)
    Had enough … ?

    ARTHUR
    I’ll have your leg.

    He is kicked.

    Right!

    The BLACK KNIGHT kicks him again and ARTHUR chops his leg off.

    The BLACK KNIGHT keeps his balance with difficulty.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    I’ll do you for that.

    ARTHUR
    You’ll what … ?

    BLACK KNIGHT
    Come Here.

    ARTHUR
    What are you going to do? Bleed on me?

    BLACK KNIGHT
    I’m invincible!

    ARTHUR
    You’re a looney.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!

    ARTHUR takes his last leg off. The BLACK KNIGHT’s body lands upright.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    All right, we’ll call it a draw.

    ARTHUR
    Come, Patsy.

    ARTHUR and PATSY start to cross the bridge.

    BLACK KNIGHT
    Running away eh? You yellow bastard, Come back here and take
    what’s coming to you. I’ll bite your legs off!
    
    
The end
